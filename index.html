	   			<h3>Always bored in the transports ? Well, we have the solution for you !</h3>
	   			<p>We spend an average of  4.7 hours per week in the public transports. And that doesn't even take into account the time we spend waiting for the train, the subway, the bus to arrive ! And most of the time, we spend those hours on our phones, listening to the same music, watching an episode of friends for the 20th time... Alone. And thus, time goes by very slowly ! Wouldn't it be better to enjoy this free time by meeting new people ?</p>

	   			<p>Thatâ€™s the goal of Way2Meet. This app will enable you to locate the people who are at the same subway station or in same bus as you are and who want to meet other persons while they are taking the public transports.
	   			Then, you can start chatting by phone and if you enjoy the conversation, you can decide to join your partner at his or her seat in the train, for instance.
	   			Maybe you will even meet an old friend you thought you would never see again ! Or you could also find someone who will become a real friend or even your soulmate.</p>

	 			<h3>Safety first !</h3>
	 			<p> By the way, don't worry, you won't find yourself in front of someone suspicious ! Indeed, our app has an identity recognition system that requires the user to take a picture of himself/herself with its ID card.
	 			Moreover, we have a criteria based algorithm which will enable you to meet people based on your criterias such as the age, gender, interests, job, languages, place of residence, etc. You will also choose what type of relation you want to have with those people : friendship, dating, speaking just once for fun, etc.
	 			If you're more the adventurous type, the app can also chose randomly, for you, a person to encounter that is just near you !</p>

	 			<p>And the best for last : this app will be completely free !</p>
